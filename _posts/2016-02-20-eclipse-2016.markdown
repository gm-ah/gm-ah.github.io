IIRC, I only got one total solar eclipse experience when I was very young. The government did a very good job educating citizen  not to be afraid but in the same time also be very cautious as it would gave an eye health problem. That was including social advertising and the one I still remember was in "Si Unyil" series, telling stories of traditional folk tale about solar eclipse with Buto Ijo character eating the sun.

Scientist (astronomers) has told us that this year, Indonesia will have a total solar eclipse happened in March 9. Some of the cities (maps above) will have 1-3 min darkness during daytime.

I'm tempted to go up north, nearest place to get the exprience, to Palembang or Bangka.

Will I? Don't know yet
